# Tinby

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/tinby`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tinby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tinby

## Usage

First, initialize Tinby::Client with your registered facebook email, your registered facebook password, your facebook url:

```
client = Tinby::Client.new(REGISTERED_FACEBOOK_EMAIL, REGISTERED_FACEBOOK_PASSWORD, FACEBOOK_URL)
```

If you want to get your profile ? like this:
```
client.profile
```

If you want to get recommended users ? like this:
```
client.recommended_users
```
and they return JSON:
